# Schematics

Temporary avionics schematics that haven't been reviewed yet, but need to be
saved for documentation purposes.

## Listing

- Ignition-System - Provisional ignition control box ("football") schematics.
  Inaccurate due to missing wires in football and broken conenctions.
- Prop-Avionics - Schematics for the propulsion avionics system and DAQ plane
- SolenoidRelay1 - Schematic for the solenoid control relay for connection to
  the raspberry pi.
- Transole - Prototype transistor based solenoid switching using GPIO level
  outputs and a heckin' large transistor (n-channel MOSFET). This is a *untested
  prototype* and should not be used in production until more research has been
  completed. Credit Sasha and Lin for research and design
